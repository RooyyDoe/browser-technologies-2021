# Browser Technologies

For this assignment I will design an interactive application. I need to make sure that all users, with all browsers, can see, hear and / or feel at least the core functionality in every context. The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to make an online online interactive appliaction using `Progressive Enhancement` and `Feature Detection` so that the application will always work.

## Case

I want to be able to fill out a survey where the questions are aimed at gamers, with different answer options. If I don't finish the survey, I want to pick up where I left off later.

## Layers ( Progressive Enhancement )

I want to create a survey for people that have interests in games. The survey will exist out of four different pages where the user will be answering some questions I've come up with. I will start to make the functional/reliable layer first. this will mainly exists out of plain HTML. When I have this working i'll go on with the usable and pleasurable layers.
